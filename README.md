# 12 Weeks Of Code

### What this is -  

A log of my JavaScript learning over a period of 12 weeks.  

I will log weekly what I have studied and learnt for that week.  

I was going to do a 100 days of code however I don't want to commit to logging my progress daily. Logging daily doesn't work for me. Weekly I am comfortable with.
